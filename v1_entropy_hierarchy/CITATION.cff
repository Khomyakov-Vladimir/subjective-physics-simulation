notes: >
  This version corresponds to the first implementation of the model and provides reproducible results
  for a static threshold Îµ and hierarchical observer structure.

  However, some theoretical assumptions (e.g., projection formalism, dimensionality) have been clarified in version 2 (v2),
  which introduces adaptive thresholds and a refined model of cognitive entropy.

  For current work and citation, please use version 2:
