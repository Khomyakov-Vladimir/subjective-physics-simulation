## ‚úÖ Statement of Correction

The current version (v2) refines and extends the initial formulation published as v1.  
While the first version captured the core idea of observer-induced entropy via cognitive thresholds,  
certain assumptions ‚Äî such as the definition of the projection operator $F_\epsilon$ and the dimensional structure of the process ‚Äî  
were clarified and formalized in v2.

Version v2 supersedes v1 as the authoritative reference.  
The earlier conceptual series *‚ÄúCognitive Simulator and Subjective Physics‚Äù [v1‚Äìv7]* is now deprecated and should be treated as a heuristic precursor.
